    <img src="img/samanea1.jpg" alt="Cénizaro Tree">
    <h3>Scientific Name: <em>Samanea saman</em></h3>
    <br> <br>
    <h4>Family: Fabaceae</h4>
    <br>
    <h4>Description:</h4>
    
    <p>The <strong>Cénizaro Tree</strong> is a venerable giant of nature, characterized by its thick, low trunk with almost black bark. Its imposing branches can extend up to <strong>30 meters</strong>, reaching up to three times the tree's total height. During the dry season on the Pacific slope, the cénizaro stands out with its attractive pink flowers featuring long reddish stamens, which attract <strong>bees, insects, and insectivorous birds</strong>. Its dense canopy provides an ideal refuge for various wildlife.</p>
    
    <p>From its flowers emerge abundant pods of up to <strong>10 cm long</strong>, which contain a thick, sweet nectar. This nectar, with its penetrating smell and taste, is appreciated by some, while for others, it may cause digestive disturbances.</p>
    
    <p>The rough bark and massive branches of the cénizaro make it an ideal tree for hanging gardens with orchids, bromeliads, pitahayas, and other epiphytic plants. Its large canopy offers perfect shade for livestock in the expansive pastures of Guanacaste. Furthermore, the cénizaro's ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it an excellent soil rejuvenator.</p>
    
    <p>It is a fast-growing species, and its dark, heavy wood has long been used in the production of luxurious furniture such as dining sets, bedroom sets, shelves, and crafts. Wood scraps are also used as high-quality firewood.</p>
    
    <p>The cénizaro reproduces easily through seeds. These must be extracted from the fruit, as they do not open on their own. Afterwards, they should be thoroughly washed to remove the pulp, and it is recommended to immerse them in boiling water to speed up germination.</p>
