<h3>Scientific Name: <em>Nasua narica</em></h3>
<br> <br>
<h4>Family: Procyonidae</h4>
<br>
<h4>Description:</h4>

<p>The <strong>coati</strong> is characterized by its long tail and snout. Its coloration is pale brown with black, and it features a mask over its eyes, while the snout, chin, and throat are whitish. Its upright tail measures between 50 and 65 cm in length, and it generally weighs between 5 and 9 kg.</p>

<p>This animal is diurnal; males are solitary, while females and young tend to form very social groups. Its adaptability to humans has made the <em>Nasua narica</em> common near camping areas or garbage dumps, although its behavior has changed due to human presence.</p>

<p>Its diet is highly varied, including crabs, lizards, frogs, bird eggs, mice, snakes, worms, as well as fruits like almond and hog plum. They forage both on the forest floor and in tree branches.</p>

<p>The coati is found in almost the entire country, from Dry Forest to Rainforest and Cloud Forest, and can be found from sea level up to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
