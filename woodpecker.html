    <h3>Scientific Name: <em>Campephilus guatemalensis</em></h3>
    <br> <br>
    <h4>Family: Picidae</h4>
    <br>
    <h4>Description:</h4>
    
    <p>The <strong>Silver-beaked Woodpecker</strong> measures between <strong>35 and 38 cm</strong>. Adults have predominantly black upper plumage, contrasting with their <strong>ivory-colored beak</strong> and a characteristic bushy crest. A white stripe runs from both sides of the neck down to the shoulders, almost forming a "V" shape on the back. The throat is black, while the underparts are mostly white, adorned with <strong>thick black bars</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>A way to distinguish the <strong>female</strong> Silver-beaked Woodpecker is the <strong>absence of a white facial stripe</strong>, making it easily recognizable.</p>
    
    <p>The distribution range of this woodpecker extends from <strong>Mexico to Panama</strong>, including countries like Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. It inhabits <strong>tropical and subtropical forests</strong>, as well as mangroves, where it often forages in the upper parts of trunks and main branches of large trees.</p>
    
    <p>The diet of the Silver-beaked Woodpecker primarily consists of <strong>large beetle larvae</strong>, which it skillfully forages in the high canopy of the forests.</p>
