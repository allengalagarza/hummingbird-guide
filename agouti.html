<h3>Scientific Name: <em>Dasyprocta punctata</em></h3>
<br> <br>
<h4>Family: Dasyproctidae</h4>
<br>
<h4>Description:</h4>

<p>The <strong>guatusa</strong> has a small tail and reddish-brown fur, similar to pigs. Unlike the paca, it lacks spots, and its average size is between <strong>42 and 64 cm</strong>, with a weight of <strong>2 to 3 kg</strong>. Although it is not a burrower, the guatusa builds its burrow underground, often using intertwined branches.</p>

<p>The current situation of the guatusa is stable in areas where primary or secondary forests are preserved. Its main natural predators include felines such as the jaguar (<em>Panthera onca</em>), the puma (<em>Felis concolor</em>), the jaguarundi (<em>Herpailurus yagouaroundi</em>), the boa (<em>Boa constrictor</em>), and the coyote (<em>Canis latrans</em>).</p>

<p>Its diet consists of all kinds of fruits, vegetables, and some types of leaves. The guatusa has a peculiar way of eating, holding its food with its front paws and bringing it to its mouth while sitting on its hindquarters. This allows it to eat comfortably while staying alert to potential predators. It can be found in almost any area where primary or secondary forests are preserved, from southern Mexico to northern Argentina.</p>
