    <h3>Scientific Name: <em>Ceiba pentandra</em></h3>
    <br> <br>
    <h4>Family: Malvaceae</h4>
    <br>
    <h4>Description:</h4>
    
    <p>The <strong>Ceiba Tree</strong> is the national tree of the sister Republic of <strong>Guatemala</strong>. The ancient and mysterious Mayans worshiped it under the name <em>yax-che</em>, considering it sacred due to their belief that it held the entire Universe together while also separating it. This fascination is evident when contemplating one of the most imposing specimens of the species, which can reach up to <strong>80 meters in height</strong> and more than <strong>4 meters in diameter</strong> at the base of its trunk.</p>
    
    <p>A single branch of the ceiba can be larger and more robust than most tree species. Its vast canopy harbors a complex ecosystem of plants and animals, providing refuge for birds and other living beings. Its small flowers attract <strong>bees and insects</strong>, and its fruits produce fine cotton fiber, used for rustic applications like nests for newly hatched chicks and more sophisticated uses like lining life jackets and pillows.</p>
    
    <p>The ceiba belongs to the select group of forest species known as <strong>CARBON CATCHERS</strong>, significantly contributing to the capture of carbon dioxide. The name "ceiba" comes from an ancient Antillean word, although its exact meaning remains a mystery.</p>
