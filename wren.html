    <h3>Scientific Name: <em>Regulus regulus</em></h3>
    <br> <br>
    <h4>Family: Regulidae</h4>
    <br>
    <h4>Description:</h4>
    
    <p>The <strong>goldcrest</strong> (<em>Regulus regulus</em>) is the smallest passerine bird in Europe, measuring 9 cm in length and having a wingspan of 14 cm, weighing between 5 and 6 g. It is often seen on the lower branches of trees, where it feeds. It is distinguished by its greenish-brown plumage and a black band with a yellow center on its crown.</p>
    
    <p>Its call is whistling and very insistent, while its song is sharp, fast, modulated, and ends with flourishes.</p>
    
    <p>It builds a small cup-shaped nest made of moss and lichens and lays seven or eight eggs in two broods, between April and July.</p>
    
    <p>Its diet consists of small insects and spiders, which it searches for among foliage and on the ground.</p>
    
    <p>It breeds in almost all of Europe, except for northern Scandinavia, Iceland, and the southern Mediterranean regions of Europe. Its habitat consists of forests, especially coniferous forests, at altitudes between 800 and 2200 meters above sea level; individuals in winter may descend to the coast.</p>
