    <h3>Scientific Name: <em>Cebus capucinus</em></h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Family: Cebidae</h4>
    <br>
    <h4>Description:</h4>
    
    <p><strong>The intelligent and agile White-faced Capuchin Monkey</strong> is one of the easiest primates to observe in protected wilderness areas.</p>
    
    <p>Also known in some countries as the <strong>Capuchin Monkey</strong>, its name comes from the color of its fur, which resembles the habit of a Capuchin monk. Its cream or yellowish fur covers its face, neck, chest, shoulders, and part of its arms, while the rest of its body is black. Its face is <strong>pinkish</strong>, and it has a long <strong>prehensile tail</strong>, which provides great agility in the trees. It is a diurnal animal, traveling in <strong>noisy groups</strong> of up to more than 30 individuals while searching for food at different levels of the forest.</p>
    
    <p>The body of the white-faced capuchin, along with its head, measures approximately <strong>45 cm</strong>, while its <strong>tail is longer than its body</strong>. It weighs between <strong>1.4 and 4.3 kg</strong>, with males generally being larger than females.</p>
    
    <p>This primate is extremely versatile in terms of habitat, inhabiting everything from <strong>dry and wet tropical forests</strong> to <strong>mangroves and mature secondary forests</strong>. In Costa Rica, it can be found in national parks such as <strong>Guanacaste, Santa Rosa, Palo Verde, Carara, Manuel Antonio, Braulio Carrillo, Tortuguero, and Corcovado</strong>. Its geographic distribution extends from Honduras to Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
    
    <p>The white-faced capuchin's diet is based on <strong>fruits from palm trees and other trees</strong>, such as guava, fig, jocote, Guanacaste tree, guarumo, indio desnudo, ceiba, and cornizuelo. It also feeds on <strong>insects</strong> like cicadas, grasshoppers, ants, butterfly larvae, and beetles, complementing its diet with <strong>small animals</strong> such as lizards and mammals.</p>
