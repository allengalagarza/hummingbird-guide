    <h3>Scientific Name: <em>Canis latrans</em></h3>
    <br> <br>
    <h4>Family: Canidae</h4>
    <br>
    <h4>Description:</h4>
    
    <p>The <strong>coyote</strong> is a carnivorous mammal belonging to the family of dogs, wolves, jackals, and foxes (Canidae). Its scientific name means <em>"howling dog"</em>. This animal measures less than <strong>60 cm</strong> in height and between <strong>74 and 94 cm</strong> in length, not including the tail. Its weight varies between <strong>8 and 16 kg</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>Its coloration ranges from gray to cinnamon, sometimes with reddish tints. The ears and snout appear long compared to its head. It can be easily identified by its thick, bushy tail, which it often carries close to the ground. Its slender build distinguishes it from its larger relative, the gray wolf, which can weigh between <strong>35 and 80 kg</strong>. Although the coyote may appear malnourished at first glance, it is actually a healthy animal.</p>
    
    <p>The coyote is an extremely adaptable species in terms of both habitat and diet. It lives on average <strong>six years</strong>. Despite being heavily hunted, it is one of the few large animals that has expanded its habitat since the European conquest of America. The species has occupied areas in North America that were previously inhabited by wolves and has also adapted to consuming garbage and domestic animals. Although it sometimes gathers in packs, the coyote is generally a solitary animal.</p>
