    <h3>Scientific name: <em>Crotalus simus</em></h3>
    <br><br>
    <h4>Family: Viperidae</h4>
    <br><br>
    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>
    In Costa Rica, the rattlesnake (<em>Crotalus simus</em>) inhabits low-altitude areas, at less than 500 meters above sea level, mainly in the Northern Pacific region. However, some specimens have been recorded at higher elevations, especially in the central area of the country. They prefer to live in tropical rainforests, with dense foliage and proximity to water bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
    Rattlesnakes are known for their defensive behavior. If they feel threatened, they slightly raise their heads and shake the tip of their tails, where the characteristic "rattle" is located, producing a loud and distinctive sound to warn potential predators. Thanks to this behavior, many accidents with this species can be avoided, as their warning sound alerts others to their presence before they attack.
    </p>
    <p>
    These snakes can reach considerable sizes, measuring up to 180 cm, with males generally being longer than females. Their large size makes them efficient predators.
    </p>
    <p>
    The diet of the rattlesnake mainly consists of small mammals such as rats and mice, although they also hunt lizards and other small animals.
