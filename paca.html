<h3>Scientific Name: <em>Agouti paca</em></h3>
<br> <br>
<h4>Family: Rodentia</h4>
<br>
<h4>Description:</h4>

<p>The <strong>paca</strong> (<em>Agouti paca</em>) measures between 60 and 79 cm in length, with a height of 35 cm and a tail measuring 2 to 3 cm. Its weight ranges between 7 and 10 kg. Its fur is bristly, brown or orange with bands of rounded white spots. The head is large, with bulging cheeks, short brown ears, long vibrissae (whiskers), and large, well-spaced eyes.</p>

<p>Gestation lasts between 145 and 155 days, after which litters of 1 to 3 young are born. The characteristics of the paca may vary depending on the region it inhabits.</p>

<p>This animal is an important hunting resource due to its meat, which poses a threat to the species, along with habitat destruction caused by deforestation.</p>

<p>In Costa Rica, the paca is a protected wild species, and its hunting is prohibited. In other Latin countries like Panama and Mexico, its use is regulated by environmental authorities. In the Peruvian Amazon basin and these countries, it is also semi-domesticated due to the nutritional quality of its meat and its low fat content.</p>
