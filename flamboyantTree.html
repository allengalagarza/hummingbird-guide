    <h3>Scientific Name: <em>Delonix regia</em></h3>
    <br> <br>
    <h4>Family: Fabaceae</h4>
    <br>
    <h4>Description:</h4>
    
    <p>The <strong>Flamboyant Tree</strong> generally reaches a height of <strong>8 meters</strong>, although in optimal conditions it can grow up to <strong>12 meters</strong>. Its foliage is dense and very spread out, but in areas with marked dry seasons, the tree sheds its leaves; however, in less severe conditions, it can be evergreen, meaning it retains its leaves year-round.</p>
    
    <p>The flowers of the flamboyant tree are large, with four petals that can reach up to <strong>8 cm</strong> in length, in addition to a fifth petal called the banner, which is longer and has yellow and white spots. There is a natural variety called <em>Delonix regia flavida</em> that has completely yellow flowers. The mature pods are woody, dark brown in color, measuring <strong>60 cm</strong> in length and <strong>5 cm</strong> in width. The seeds are small and weigh around <strong>0.4 g</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>The leaves measure between <strong>30 and 50 cm</strong> in length, and each has between <strong>20 and 40 pairs</strong> of primary leaflets, also known as pinnate. Each primary leaflet is divided into <strong>10 to 20 pairs</strong> of secondary leaflets.</p>
